# GardenPi Python Project
We use python to read data from our sensors on a Rasbperry Pi. Therefore we have some dependencies:
- [Adafruit_Python_DHT](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT) for a digital air temperatur and humidity sensor
- [InfluxDB Python Library](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb-python) to write data to time series database

As you may have noticed, the code style isn't very well. That's our first Python script and we did this in the night during some drinking, please apologize. If you have some recommendations, we would be very thankful for a pull request.
